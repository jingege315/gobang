I am interested in gobang,

so I am going to use python to draw GUI and program a powerful AI to have fun!

Welcome to contribute code or correct the error about my English programmer.

## gobang plan
* First,I build a UI and rule about gobang to prepare to develop the AI in next step.
* Second,write a evaluate function and a function to found out valuable points to calculate next.
* Third,I will use the traditional way using alpha-beta algorithm to design a easy AI.
* Ultimately,I am going to use the way like alphago.
Now,I have finish the step 2.

## how to run
there are three python file to run.
1. main_base_without_player_control.py
2. main_base_with_player_control.py
3. main_AI_stupid_attacking.py
consuming you want to play with the stupid AI,you can:
