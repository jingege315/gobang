# gobang
I am interested in gobang,so I am going to use python to draw GUI and program a powerful AI to have fun!

I will implement my idea by alpha-beta algorithm and alphago-zero algorithm. 

Welcome to contribute code and correct the error about my English programmer.

## gobang plan
* First,I build a UI and rule about gobang to prepare to develop the AI in next step.
* Second,write a evaluate function and a function to found out valuable points to calculate next.
* Third,I will use the traditional way using alpha-beta algorithm to design a easy AI.
* Ultimately,I am going to use the way like alphago.
Now,I have finish the step 2.

## how to run
there are three python files to run.
1. main_base_without_player_control.py
2. main_base_with_player_control.py
3. main_AI_stupid_attacking.py

__assuming you want to play with the stupid AI,you can:__
windowsï¼š
```
py -3 main_AI_stupid_attacking.py
```
linux:
```
python3 main_AI_stupid_attacking.py
```
I find the AI is so stupid that it pay all attention to attacking me,so it is difficult if I only defend the attack of AI.
